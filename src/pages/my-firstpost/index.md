Don't build a website with last decade's tech. The future of the web is mobile, JavaScript and API.

## What is Gatsby

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.It's rich data plugin ecosystem lets you build sites with the data you want — from one or many sources: Pull data from headless CMSs, SaaS services, APIs, databases, your file system, and more directly into your pages using GraphQL.Gatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. It loads only the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast.

## Why do we use it?

Gatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers — ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are. Forget complicated deploys with databases and servers and their expensive, time-consuming setup costs, maintenance, and scaling fears. Gatsby.js builds your site as “static” files which can be deployed easily on dozens of services.
